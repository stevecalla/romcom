//----   Iteration 0 -----//

/* Goal: When the page loads, we should see a cover with a
randomly selected image, title, and tagline which
includes two random descriptors */

Date/Time: Tuesday, 12/8 from 4p-5p & 6p-8p

Repo:
1) Forked, cloned the Repo
2) Need Matt to pull the repo

Setup:
1) As a team, send a Slack message to your assigned instructor (PM) with: the forked GitHub repo
2) the GitHub Pages deployed site
    Under your repoâ€™s settings, scroll down to GitHub Pages and set it up to deploy your main branch
3) the DTR

Iteration 0
1) Where are the current cover image, title, tagline sourced?
- these resources (image et al) are HARDCODED in the index.html file

2) Can we change the current current page (w/out randomness)
- we weren't able to use a reference to Cover.js yet
- we decided to move the Cover class to the main.js file temporarily
- we also needed to move the variable arrays from the data.js temporarily into main.js
- then declared variable mainCover to create instances of Cover(s)
- to do so we declared a variable mainCover
- mainCover creates new instances of Cover with 4 parameters
- each parameter used a hardcode index call to getRandomIndex
- 4 parameters are covers, titles, description1, description2

2a)Variable mainPage that assigns the mainPage info
- could not achieve b/c we don't know how to reference main.js to data.js et al
- will tackle tomorrow (see list below)

3) Can we randomize
- we console.log the getRandomIndex array to fully understand the output (see below)
// var randNum = (Math.random() * covers.length);
// console.log(covers.length);
// console.log(randNum);
// console.log(Math.floor(randNum));
- we discussed how to make the mainCover instance creation process dynamic
- decided we need to make the index dynamic
- matt suggested we'd need an array

4) When page loads we should see random load of cover, title, descriptors
- TBD
- Need to understand the connection b/ main.js and cover.js - done
- Need to understand the connection b/ main.js and index.html - done
- Need to understand the connection b/ main.js and index.html - done
- Files linked via html last three lines and need to use browser console to access integration
- Sample of variable pulling the HTML element
var coverImage = document.querySelector(".cover-image"); - need to revisit
var tagline1 = document.querySelector(".tagline-1"); //row21
var tagline2 = document.querySelector(".tagline-2"); // row21
var coverTitle = document.querySelector(".cover-title"); - need to revisit
  - Do homework to help with understanding


Date/Time: Wednesday, 12/9 from 6p-8p
1) git commit/push/pull - done
2) create PR template from this slack in the frontend 2011 help channel - done

2) retro - done
2a) Did we complete Iteration 0
2b) let Matt drive 60 min  git commit/push/pull; Steve - done
3) pseudo control and code quality file - done
4) review code from yesterday (what is getRandomIndex(covers) actually pulling?) - done
5) Next Step - Did we complete iteration 0; how to complete
6) Next Step - Get into iteration 0
7) READme file
8) Other

Iteration 0
- See Step 4 above

Iteration 1 - Show Random Cover
Goals:
A) Every time the user clicks the Show New Random Cover button, a new random cover is created
hint: you may need to update the value of the provided currentCover variable
hint: use that Cover class!

Pseudo Code:
1) ABC
2) ABC

B) Every time the user clicks the Show New Random Cover button, the random cover is displayed
hint: you may need to create a function that displays information on the DOM

Pseudo Code:
1) ABC
2) ABC
