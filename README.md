## Overview - Romantic Comedy (RomCom) Covers

People say that romance novels are formulaic. Well … maybe that’s true. RomCom is a website that allows a user to generate romance novel covers.

The user can randomly generate a cover, can make a cover and save a collection of covers. The site is accessible at [here](https://stevecalla.github.io/romcom/). All the project requirements can be found [here](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-1/romcom-pair.html).

## Sample Cover

![COVER EXAMPLE](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/72281855/102010178-ad7b6300-3cf9-11eb-8dbd-452ec92facb8.png)

## Functionality

Current Functionality:

1. Generate a randomly created cover upon load and random button push.
2. A create a cover form exists, accepts a image URL, cover, title, and descriptive text input.
3. Save a cover.
4. Delete a saved cover.

Functionality Under Development:

1. See known issue list below.

Known Issues:

1. Saved covers functionality will duplicate (in the saved cover view) when a user clicks the save cover button if the saved cover is the viewed same as the prior click of the button. This is due to the fact that the cover has 4 of the 5 cover elements the same but the saved cover id is refreshed for every click of the saved cover button. Covers will not duplicate if all five of the class elements are the same.

Future Enhancements:

1. Fix known issues above.
2. Continue to refine code to eliminate unnecessary, duplicate or inefficient code. Review and refactor functions.
3. Create a reference to an online library of covers for the user to select.
4. Add validation to the input cover form.
5. Add clear instructions on the type of link required to add a cover on the input cover form.
6. Implement data validation and error handling into the form (disable the button until all fields are filled, provide error messages if data entered is not correct, etc)
7. When a user single clicks a saved cover, create a modal to view it larger.
8. Allow users to drag and drop saved posters into whatever order they want them to appear
